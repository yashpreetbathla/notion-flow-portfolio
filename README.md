Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Optional: Set up view counter (skip if not needed)
# 1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
# 2. Enable Realtime Database
# 3. Add these security rules to your Realtime Database:
{
  "rules": {
    "portfolio": {
      "views": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": "newData.val() === (data.exists() ? data.val() : 0) + 1",
        ".validate": "newData.val() > 0 && newData.val() <= 1000000"
      }
    }
  }
}

# 4. Create a .env file with your Firebase credentials:
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-auth-domain"
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-storage-bucket"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-messaging-sender-id"
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"

# 5. In your Hero component, set showViews={true} to enable the view counter
# 6. If you're deploying to GitHub Pages:

#      VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
#      VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
#      VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL
#      VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
